# probably need some special care!)
# Set this to ON in order to link a static build of UHD:

# To add UHD as a dependency to this project, add a line such as this:
find_package(UHD 3.15.0 REQUIRED)
find_package(glfw3 3.3 REQUIRED)
find_package(OpenGL REQUIRED)


# This example also requires Boost.
# Set components here, then include UHDBoost to do the actual finding
